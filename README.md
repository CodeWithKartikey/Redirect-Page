# Redirect Page

This repository contains a simple HTML page that displays a countdown timer and automatically redirects the user to a specified URL.

---

The page features responsive design for different screen sizes, uses the "Montserrat" font from Google Fonts, and includes a script that automatically redirects the user to the home page after a 10-second countdown.

---

To change the redirection URL or adjust the countdown timer, modify the respective values in the script section of the HTML file.
